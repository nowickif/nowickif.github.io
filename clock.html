                                  <p>The 7-segment LED clock is a solo project I undertook in my Intro to Modern Making Class. It exposed me to new areas of making I have never explored, and left me with an amazing-looking programmable clock.</p>
                                  <p>The clock shows the time by lighting up different segments of LED strips that area shaped as digits.</p>
                                  <p>In terms of the control of LED strips as well as timing, the clock has an Arduino Uno and an RTC module that I connected to a USB charging cube.</p>
                                  <p>It has different color schemes, light brightness, as well as hour formats - 12/24h - all of which are controlled by pushbuttons.</p>
                                  <p>It is power by plugging it into an electric outlet or connecting its USB to a laptop or power bank.</p>
                                  <p>Overall, I am really satisfied with how the clock works in such an ingenuine way and is a completely self-made tool that now serves me very well.</p>

                              <p>In thinking about this project, I found a significant motivation to use an Arduino and 3D printing, and play around with electronics because I was never extensively exposed to them. to do something useful.</p>
                              <p>I really wanted my project to be something useful and browsing <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/">Thingiverse</a>, I was really inspired by this a DIY project called the <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3014572">Retro 7 segment clock</a>.</p>
                              <p>It looks absolutely amazing, particularly under dim lighting, and gives me a way to have fun with the clock's code.</p>
                              <p>In the time-lapse on the right side, the clock is in an automatic color change mode and exhibits the features of an actual clock - changes the hour.</p>

                                  <p>The clock's RTC (real-time clock) module indicates the time and uses an additional battery that allows it to remember the current hour.</p>
                                  <p>The clock has in-built LED stripes, segments of which light up based on what hour it is.</p>
                                  <p>The casing is 3D printed PLA plastic, whereas the diffusers (bright areas through which LED lights are visible) is resin cured with the SLA technology.</p>
                                  <p>With all these features, we looked for the combinations of features that yields the highest classification accuracy.</p>
                                  <p>Learning models used are presented on the slide. We used sklearn to implement them.</p>
                                  <p>By default, the algorithms applied were evaluated by test accuracies in 5-fold cross-validation.</p>
                                  <p>We strarted out with 3 artists and then having trained algorithms on all 255 possible combinations of features, we scaled the dataset up from 3 artists to 50 artists.</p>
                                  <p>90% accuracy was the highest achieved for Paul Cezanne, Rembrandt, and van Gogh. The subset of features that yielded this accuracy was then applied to the rest of the dataset.</p>
                                  <p>The graph on the right side of the slide shows that the accuracy starts at around 93% for 2 artists and drops to about 22% for all 50 artists.</p>
                                  <p>In terms of methods, random forest initially performs best, but for more than 5 artists, it is Softmax Regressiion, KNN and SVM that have the highest accuracy.</p>

                                  <p>In the other part of the project, we applied a convolutional neural network to compare the capabilities of shallow Machine Learning and Deep Learning in this task.</p>
                                  <p>In terms of CNN's architecture, the one on the graph with 7 fully connected layers yielded us the highest accuracy.</p>
                                  <p>The plot on the right-hand side of the slide shows a comparison between the best shallow ML algorithm and CNN. For a small number of artists, the performance is similar, but as there are more categories, CNN becomes superior.</p>
                                  <p>For instance, for 2 artists, the accuracy is about the same but for 25 artists, CNN performs 13% better than shallow ML.</p>
                                  <p>Then, for the whole dataset, CNN has 40% accuracy, which means it outperforms shallow ML by 18%.</p>

                                  <p>The main takeaways are:</p>
                                  <p>1. CNN performed at least as good or significantly better than shallow Machine Learning algorithms.</p>
                                  <p>2. In shallow Machine Learning, the performance drops steadily with an increasing number of artists, while for the CNN, the drop in accuracy slows down with more artists.</p>
                                  <p>3. Interestingly, the highest accuracy shallow Machine Learning yielded was only for a subset of our Computer Vision techniques.</p>
                                  <p>Self-reflection:</p>
                                  <p>Overall, the project was extremely interesting and I have found it inspiring to explore how Computer Vision and different layers of a CNN interpret elements of art. The fact that it was art rather than pictures of objects made it challenging to adapt and interpret some of these techniques. Another thing that I particularly enjoyed was writing the script! It is quite powerful in how the dataset can analyzed and scaled, too.</p>
                                  <p>The documentation can be found below and is here mostly to show just how extensive the code is. If you were interested in accessing the Jupyter notebook, I will be more than happy to share it!</p>
