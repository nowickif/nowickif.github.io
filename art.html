                                  <p>Being an enthusiast of art, I have always been looking for artwork that is not as expensive as actual pieces of art but also more pronounced than a poster. In my final project for the DIY class, I believe I discovered what I am look for!</p>
                                  <p>I realized that laser cutting and etching acrylic sheets of different colors may allow me to create a painting by combining combining them into one painting.</p>
                                  <p>Therefore, the goal of my project was to create a physical painting with the used of colored plexiglass. To do that, I planned to apply computer vision techniques to exctract the edges of paintings, based on which I could then laser cut the desired shapes.</p>
                                  <p>The painting I planned to create is The Great Wave off Kanagawa by Hokusai Katsushika. It is one of my sister's favorite pieces of art, and I was hoping to gift it to her for Chistmas!</p>

                          <div class="mb-12">
                              <p>I was really inspired by different processes of what is possible with materials when used for decorative purposes.</p>
                              <p>First of all, picture wood engravings are relatively popular and that really stimulated me to think about other materials with which I could get similar results with more colors.</p>
                              <p>Having had some experience with acrylic sheets in my previous project, I realized that they offer several colors as well as shades with engraving, which prompted me to use it.</p>
                              <p>Another inspiration came from my machine learning project, in which I used computer vision techniques to extract edges of paintings to classify them the their artist.</p>
                              <p>Considering this, I applied the edge exctraction methods to get the shapes of areas of different colors in a painting. The idea was to cut them out in different colors and combine in one piece.</p>
                              <p>Finally, my last inspiration was mine and my sister's obsession with Japan. She is the person whom I will gift the painting!</p>
                              <p>Therefore, the concept was to extract shapes from a painting, laser cut and engrave them on acrylic sheets, and then glue all the pieces on plywood.</p>

                              <div class="mb-12">
                                  <p>To do engraving and laser cutting out of sheet acrylic, I needed to extract shape from a painting. Computer vision techniques were really helpful with that.</p>
                                  <p>I wrote a script in Python which, using the OpenCV library, allows to get different levels of edges by trimming the thresholds of the Canny Edge technique.</p>
                                  <p>In arriving at the actual painting I was going to fabricate, I explored different pieces of art and how well-defined edges are in those.</p>
                                  <p>The photos on the left hand side indicate that edge extraction left messy pictures and also that for some paintings, defining the main shapes seemed impossible due to their complexity.</p>
                                  <p>Considering this, I used a simplified version of the Great Wave off Kanagawa and then tidied up the image to have well-defined areas of the same color.</p>

                              <div class="mb-12">
                                  <p>I explored a lot in terms of what colors I will be able to use in the painting. I look at different colors, raster settings, and number of passes.</p>
                                  <p>In the process, for each color that I thought might be useful, I created engraved boxes with different raster settings to see what shades of different colors I can use.</p>
                                  <p>Another area of exploration was ensuring that no piece is so thin that the laser cutter's size causes that piece to shrink so much that it disappears.</p>
                                  <p>In the first iteration of the painting, I found that many the width of many pieces was to small, and so many white elements were missing.</p>
                                  <p>In terms of the colors, I also learned a lot of how these shades of colors actually worked together. In turned out that even if there was a difference between engraved boxes, in the painting that was not always as apparent.</p>
                                  <p>In addition, with some acrylic sheets, I was able to get a lot change in color with engraving, while with others not so much. Matching colors from a painting to those I can produce with laser cutting proved very interesting.</p>

                                  <p>At the end of the day, I was relatively happy with the prototype, but I also generated a lot of feedback for my next, final iteration.</p>
                                  <p>I decided to use 7 different colors of acrylic that are listed in the photo on the left side. In addition to the painting itself, I also decided to include a frame.</p>
                                  <p>In a manner similar to what coloring books do, I classified each area given by my computer vision function to a color I was able to product. In total, I used 12 different shaded of colors for the painting.</p>
                                  <p>Once I had a plan in, I got to laser cutting, which altogether took around 10 hours. The piece of the sky was particularly long - 1 engraving pass on chosen settings took around an hour.</p>
                                  <p>Finally, I got all the pieces I needed and I began gluing each part to plywood. For gluing, I used acrylic cement. </p>

                                  <p>Here, on the right side is the final "painting" I created. It has really pronounced and vivid colors, and looks really composed.</p>
                                  <p>The gaps between each piece of acrylic are small, and for the most part invisible.</p>
                                  <p>I am particularly happy with Japanese signs, the color scheme, and the way the whole piece comes together to form a painting out of disctint shapes.</p>
                                  <p>Looking up close, there are some issues that I would most definitely fix next time around. In particular, the gluing of the frame is visible.</p>
                                  <p>In any case, I the way the painting turned out exceeded my expectations, and I am so excited to give it to my sister during Christmas of 2021.</p>
