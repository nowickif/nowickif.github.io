                                  <p>Being an enthusiast of art, I have always been looking for artwork that is not as expensive as actual pieces of art but also more pronounced than a poster. In my final project for the DIY class, I believe I discovered what I am look for!</p>
                                  <p>I realized that laser cutting and etching acrylic sheets of different colors may allow me to create a painting by combining combining them into one painting.</p>
                                  <p>Therefore, the goal of my project was to create a physical painting with the used of colored plexiglass. To do that, I planned to apply computer vision techniques to exctract the edges of paintings, based on which I could then laser cut the desired shapes.</p>
                                  <p>The painting I planned to create is The Great Wave off Kanagawa by Hokusai Katsushika. It is one of my sister's favorite pieces of art, and I was hoping to gift it to her for Chistmas!</p>

                          <div class="mb-12">
                              <p>I was really inspired by different processes of what is possible with materials when used for decorative purposes.</p>
                              <p>First of all, wood engravings that are really popular really stimulated me to think about other materials with which I could get similar results with more colors.</p>
                              <p>Having had some experience with acrylic sheets in my previous project, I realized that they offer several colors as well shades with engraving, which prompted me to use it.</p>
                              <p>Another inspiration came from my machine learning project, in which I used computer vision techniques to extract edges of paintings to classify them the their artist.</p>
                              <p>Considering this, I applied the edge exctraction methods to get the shapes of areas of different color in a painting.</p>
                              <p>Finally, my last inspiration was mine and my sister's obsession with Japan. She is the person whom I will gift the painting!</p>

                              <div class="mb-12">
                                  <p>I needed the shapes which I was going to engrave and laser cut out of sheet acrylic and computer vision techniques were really helpful with that.</p>
                                  <p>I wrote a script in Python which, using the OpenCV library, allows to get different levels of edges by trimming the thresholds of the Canny Edge technique.</p>
                                  <p>In arriving at the actual painting I was going to fabricate, I explored different pieces of art and how well-defined edges are in those.</p>
                                  <p>The photos on the left hand side indicate that edge extraction left messy pictures and also that for some paintings, defining the main shapes seemed impossible due to their complexity.</p>
                                  <p>Considering this, I used a simplified version of the Great Wave off Kanagawa and then tidied up the image to have well-defined areas of the same color.</p>

                                  <p>Having a few initial concepts in mind and on paper, I used Solidworks to formalize my design, see what constraints in terms of dimensions I will need to consider, and then create prototypes of my design. </p>
                                  <p>Explicitly defining shapes and curves in 3D based on sketches is uneasy, but since I was at the stage of creating my design, I only took inspiration from these sketches and arrived at the design in the top picture, which I then assembled with the corkscrew itself.</p>
                                  <p>I then used the CAD model to 3D print a prototype of my design out of PLA to see whether it feels the way it is supposed to. </p>
                                  <p>Although it was not quite perfect, the overall shape felt right, and I put the model into Slicer to then laser cut a wooden structure for my clay model.</p>

                                  <p>After evaluating the 3D printed prototype, I concluded that the edges were not pleasant in touch, the model felt a bit too small, and the grip did not offer a stable grasp.</p>
                                  <p>Prompted by these findings and a complete concept of what I wanted my design to be, I arrived at a final design and sketched it on paper. </p>
                                  <p>In terms of the improvements as compared to the CAD model, I decided to create smooth surfaces in-between the spaces for fingers, I enlarged the item, and I also added dimples in the areas for the fingers to allow to hold the handle more steadily.</p>
                                  <p>I complimented the final sketches with a perspective marker rendering of the grip itself.</p>

                                  <p>In order to go about the fabrication smartly, I used the aforementioned wooden structure before beginning the work with clay. </p>
                                  <p>Working with clay for the first time, I found it interesting how simple it is to form with this material. The initial stages of the work were trying to get the overall shape of my design. This part of the process was relatively easy. </p>
                                  <p>I then went on to define the shape of the grip. The handle felt good in my hand, and I also received positive feedback from my peers. </p>
                                  <p>It turned out that the detailing posed the biggest challenge. This task required a significant degree of precision - making sure to preserve the surface and its smoothness, while getting the exact shape in.</p>

                                  <p>I was able to reproduce the design I sketched, and the product fulfills my expectations: </p>
                                  <p>- Issues related to the original product are solved</p>

                                  <p>In terms of any self-reflections, the grip size does not quite match the corkscrew's size itself, but it seems that this is expected considering the size of human hands and ergonomics. </p>
